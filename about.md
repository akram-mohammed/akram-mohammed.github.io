I am a postdoctoral fellow at the UTHSC, Center for Biomedical Informatics-Department (CBMI) of Pediatrics. I have earned my Ph.D. in Biomedical Informatics with machine learning concentration from University of Nebraska Medical Center after fisnishing my Master of Science in Computer Science from State University of New York at Albany.

My research interests include data science, machine learning, and deep learning for precision medicine, cancer classification. At the CBMI  , my work focuses on designing and developing advanced real-time algorithms for predicting the onset of abnormal conditions at the bedside using data streams acquired in intensive care units. I am also keen on conducting research in high-throughput multi-omics data, computational modeling of host-pathogen interactions and open source software development.
